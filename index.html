        <h2>About Lola</h2>
        <p>Lola Bunny is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes character. Lola first appeared in the 1996 live-action/animated movie <i>Space Jam</i> and was played by voice actor Kath Soucie. She quickly became a fan favorite. A redesigned, more "looney" Lola appeared in the Cartoon Network series <i>The Looney Tunes Show</i> and was voiced by actor and comedian Kristen Wiig. Lola appeared again in the 2021 film <i>Space Jam: A New Legacy</i> and was voiced by actor and singer Zendaya. In the <i>Space Jam</i> movies, it is hinted that Lola is the love interest of Bugs Bunny. In <i>The Looney Tunes Show</i>, she does, in fact, become Bugs Bunny's girlfriend (though he isn't that into her at first). She could probably do better.</p>
